In this project, I am using the Chinook Database to write queries that answers the following SQL questions below:
With the tables included in the Chinook Database, I was also able to come up with my own SQL questions (Questions 15-17)

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
Where Country <> 'USA';

--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country= 'Brazil';

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerID= inv.CustomerID 
WHERE Country= 'Brazil';

--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title= 'Sales Support Agent';

--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId

JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId= emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId= cust.CustomerId;

--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.country, inv.total

JOIN chinook.Invoices inv ON inv.customerId= cust.customerId;

--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)    
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-31-01';

--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tr.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.Tracks tr
ON inv.TrackId= tr.TrackId;

--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.Name AS 'artist name', tr.Name AS 'track name', inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

--14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) AS 'Most sales' 
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId= cust.SupportRepId
